# Master Thesis for the M.Sc.in Applied and Computational Mathematic

The work presented here is the result of my Master Thesis for the M.Sc.in Applied and Computational Mathematics in Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
Implementation of a general way to solve PDEs by using ANNs in TensorFlow.

The code in this work have been written using the theoretical work of Jens Berg and Kaj Nystr√∂m in "A unified deep artificial neural network approach to partial differential equations in complex geometries."

To run the code you just need to run sequentially the cells in each notebook where is also, as markdown, the mathematical explanation of each part.
